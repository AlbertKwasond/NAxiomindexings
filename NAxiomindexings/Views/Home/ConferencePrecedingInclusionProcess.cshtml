            <h2>Conference Preceding Inclusion Process</h2>

            <p>
                At Axiom Indexing, we believe that conference proceedings play a critical role in disseminating knowledge and promoting academic exchange.
                As such, we are committed to indexing conference proceedings in our database to enhance their visibility and impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our conference proceeding inclusion process involves a careful evaluation of each conference and the papers presented. We follow a set of criteria to ensure that only high-quality papers are included in our database.
                These criteria are based on a thorough and comprehensive review of the papers and subsequent corrections made by the authors as evidenced by the conference organizers.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be considered for inclusion, conference proceedings must meet the following criteria:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The papers must have undergone a rigorous peer-review process, and only the approved papers will be included in our database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference proceedings must be well-organized and documented, with clear identification of the conference, its organizers, and its sponsors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The papers must be relevant to our database's scope and meet our standards for academic excellence.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we have confirmed that the conference proceedings meet these criteria, we will add them to our database, making them available to scholars, researchers, and other interested parties around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that the inclusion process can be challenging for conference organizers and authors, but we believe that it is a necessary step in promoting high-quality academic publishing.
                By working with us to meet our standards, conference organizers and authors can enhance the visibility and impact of their research in the academic community.
