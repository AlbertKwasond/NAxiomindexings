            <p>
                The process of evaluating journals at Axiom Indexing is a thorough and rigorous one that is designed to ensure that only high-quality and impactful journals are included in our database.
                The criteria used for evaluation have been established by our experienced team of experts and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant and up-to-date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our evaluation process takes into consideration a range of factors, including the quality of the journal, its impact, frequency of publication, the number of years of publication, and the peer review process, among others.
                These factors are carefully weighed and considered in the evaluation of each journal.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that the inclusion of a journal in our database is important to its authors and readers, and we take this responsibility seriously.
                Our goal is to provide a reliable and accurate database of high-quality journals that can be trusted by researchers, academics, and other stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p>
                In cases where a journal fails to meet our criteria, we may provide feedback to the journal's editors or publishers to help them improve the quality of their publication. However, we do not include such journals in our database until they meet our criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and integrity in our journal evaluation process, and we will continue to strive towards providing a valuable resource for the academic community.
