            <p>
                With the evaluation of journals, each journal at Axiom indexing would have meet a set of criteria established by Axiom and failure of any journal meet all the criteria would not be published. Some of these criteria include the quality of the journal and the impact of the journal. 
                These are the two basic criteria at Axiom but there are more and most especially, journals that meet these two basic criteria is placed at the core collection of axiom. The evaluation process typically involves the following key steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                    <h3>Criteria Definition:</h3> Clear and comprehensive criteria are established for content inclusion. This often involves considerations such as academic rigor, adherence to ethical guidelines, peer review quality, relevance to the field, and overall credibility.
               </li>
               <li>
                    <h3>Initial Screening:</h3> Journals or publications are initially screened based on the predefined criteria. This step may involve an assessment of the publication's scope, editorial board, peer review process, publication frequency, and adherence to ethical standards.
               </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Peer Review and Evaluation:</h3> Selected publications undergo in-depth peer review by subject matter experts. This evaluation assesses the scholarly merit, methodology, originality, and overall quality of the content. Peer reviewers provide feedback and recommendations based on the established criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Decision-making Process: </h3> Axiom Indexing's editorial board or review committee evaluates the peer reviewers' assessments to make informed decisions on the inclusion or exclusion of a publication in the index. This process ensures consistency and fairness in the selection process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Continuous Review and Updates: </h3> The content selection process is an ongoing endeavor. Indexed publications are periodically re-evaluated to ensure they continue to meet the established standards. This iterative process helps maintain the integrity and relevance of the indexed content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Transparency and Feedback: </h3> Axiom Indexing maintains transparency throughout the process, providing feedback to publications and fostering an open dialogue regarding selection criteria. This transparency enhances trust and credibility within the academic community.
                </li>
