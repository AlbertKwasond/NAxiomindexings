            <p>
                At Axiom Indexing, we are committed to providing the most trustworthy and reliable scholarly information to our users.
                To ensure the quality of our database, we have a rigorous journal inclusion process that evaluates each journal before it is added to our database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our inclusion process takes into account a variety of factors, including the editorial content of the journal, the diversity of the journal's topics, the frequency of its publication, the quality of its peer review process, and its citation analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be included in our database, a journal must undergo a series of assessments to ensure that it meets our high standards for academic excellence. Our team of experts carefully evaluates each journal and provides feedback to its editors to help them improve the quality of their content.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that the inclusion process can be challenging for journals, but we believe that it is a necessary step in promoting high-quality academic publishing. By working with us to meet our standards, journals can enhance their reputation and increase their visibility in the academic community.
